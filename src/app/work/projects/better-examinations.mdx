## Overview

As the UX Lead for Better Examinations Online, I led the design and development of a comprehensive online examination platform that enables educational institutions to create, administer, and manage digital assessments. Working closely with a team of frontend and backend developers, I established the core UX principles and design patterns that would guide the platform's development.

## Key Features

- **Unified Examination Platform**: Designed and implemented a cohesive system that handles the entire examination lifecycle - from exam creation and scheduling to administration, marking, and results management.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Worked on integrations with various educational systems and APIs, including learning management systems (LMS), student information systems, and authentication providers.
- **Accessibility-First Design**: Established accessibility guidelines and implemented WCAG 2.1 compliant components to ensure the platform was usable by all students, including those with disabilities.
- **Responsive Assessment Tools**: Created flexible assessment tools supporting various question types, including multiple choice, essay, and practical exercises, with real-time saving and auto-submission features.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Built a modern, component-based frontend architecture
- **AWS**: Leveraged cloud services for scalable infrastructure and reliable exam delivery
- **Storybook**: Developed and documented a comprehensive component library

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most significant challenges was designing a system that could handle high-stakes examinations while maintaining security and preventing cheating. We implemented various security measures, integrating browser lockdown, proctoring tools, and secure exam delivery mechanisms. Another key challenge was creating an intuitive interface that could accommodate different types of examinations and assessment methods while remaining accessible to users with varying technical abilities.

## Outcome

The Better Examinations Online platform has successfully served numerous educational institutions, handling thousands of examinations annually. The system's reliability and user-friendly design have significantly reduced administrative overhead while providing a secure and accessible examination environment for students. The platform's success has led to its adoption by major educational institutions and has set new standards for online examination systems in the education sector.
