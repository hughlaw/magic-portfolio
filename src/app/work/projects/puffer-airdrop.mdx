## Overview

As part of my work with Hedgey, I was tasked with creating a custom frontend for Puffer Finance's airdrop claims.

## Key Features

- **High availability**: The portal needed to be able to handle a large number of concurrent users, and needed to be able to handle a large number of requests per second.

- **Web3 wallet interaction**: The portal needed to be able to interact with the user's wallet to claim the airdrop and sign the appropriate messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The frontend was built with Next.js and Typescript.
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **MongoDB**: Required to store certain action wallet results, such as custom wallet signatures.

## Outcome

The airdrop portal worked as expected and allowed hundreds of thousands of users to claim their airdrop. The project was subsequently extended to be the basis for Hedgey's custom claim offerings, and is now used as the template for all of our custom claim portals.
