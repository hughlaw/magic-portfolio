## Overview

Development of a flexible and customizable design system using Svelte and SvelteKit. Worked in close conjunction with senior management and product managers to deliver a product that has facilitated over $1B in transaction volume and secures over $250M in Total Value Locked (TVL).

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using Svelte, TailwindCSS and Storybook, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Svelte/Sveltekit**: For fast, easy to use components and pages.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **TailwindCSS**: For simple and familiar styling with a modular approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was developing clean UX flows for complex web3 user interactions. Web3 is still somewhat in it's infancy, so dealing with many different wallet providers and expected user experiences was a challenge. We overcame this by blending some common UX flows with our own custom flows. This was especially challenging while interacting with multisig wallets, such as Gnosis Safe, where we developed a custom UX flow to guide users through the process.

## Outcome

The free-to-use app.hedgey.finance app has facilitated over $1B in transaction volume and secures over $250M in Total Value Locked (TVL) through a stable and refined UI that simplifies the complex user task of interacting with the Hedgey protocol.

Hedgey's UIs serve hundreds of thousands of end users during claim events and have helped solidify Hedgey's position as a leading DeFi protocol.
