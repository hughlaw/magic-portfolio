## Overview

As the UX Lead working on Terminalfour's flagship CMS product, I worked with a team of backend engineers and senior management to redesign the product. Working on a legacy codebase, I was asked to take hundreds of existing product features and create a more modern, user friendly product.

This involved a lot of research and investigation into the product and it's current users, finding consistent pain points and frustrations that we addressed through the redesign.

## Key Features

- **User-Centric Product Development**: Led user research initiatives and usability testing sessions to inform product decisions. Established a feedback loop with key stakeholders and end-users to ensure features aligned with real-world needs. Advocated for user-focused priorities in sprint planning and roadmap discussions.

- **User Flow Development**: Collaborated closely with stakeholders and the development team to create comprehensive user flow diagrams. These diagrams mapped out critical user journeys and interaction patterns before feature development began, ensuring a clear understanding of user needs and technical requirements. This proactive approach helped identify potential UX challenges early and streamlined the development process.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Robust backend architecture providing enterprise-level CMS functionality
- **Backbone.js**: Frontend framework for building modular, event-driven user interfaces
- **Jasmine**: Comprehensive testing framework for JavaScript code quality assurance

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most significant challenges was modernizing a 15-year-old product while maintaining its core functionality and user base. The legacy codebase required careful consideration when implementing modern frontend practices and technologies. Another major challenge was establishing consistent design principles and UI patterns across hundreds of features that had evolved independently over the years. This required extensive documentation, component libraries, and close collaboration with development teams to ensure cohesive implementation.

## Outcome

The Version 7 to Version 8 update represented the largest and most ambitious release in Terminalfour's history. The modernized interface and improved user experience helped establish Terminalfour as one of the leading CMS products for higher education worldwide. The new design system created during this process continues to guide product development, ensuring consistency and quality across new features and updates. This transformation has strengthened Terminalfour's position in the higher education market and set new standards for enterprise CMS usability.
